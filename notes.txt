Nightwatch Js
    - https://nightwatchjs.org/
    - Nightwatch JS is an E2E testing framework written in Node JS
    - Nightwatch and Chromedriver are needed and can be installed via NPM
        - npm install nightwatch chromedriver
Setup Nightwatch
    - Nightwatch requires having a nightwatch.json configuration file
    - This file will have the base configuration
    - On some systems the base configuration will have an error
        - The following line will need to be added for the server path declaration 
        - 'server_path': require('chromedriver').path
        - There is also a need to add a nightwatch.conf.js file in some instances
        - This seems to be on Windows platform and the js file should be in the root of the project

Test Runners
    - Nightwatch has its own test runner and assertion library 
    - Other frameworks have a lot of dependencies that you will have to install and tie together
    - A file can begin with module.exports to define an object
        - The test name is then defined within the object
            - This will be a function which accepts an argument
            - The argument is the browser object but you can define it to use any name
    - A specific test can also be ran
        - ./node_modules/.bin/nightwatch -t ./tests/<test_name>
        - In this case -> ./node_modules/.bin/nightwatch -t ./tests/nightwatch.basic.test.js
    - Mocha
        - Nightwatch gives users the option to use the Mocha BDD (Behavior Driven Development) interface to write your tests using their default test runner
        - Since version 1.3, Nightwatch has created their own Mocha interface that users can use so they would no longer have to create a config file 
        - nightwatch_mocha.json file is needed to be able to add test_runner to
